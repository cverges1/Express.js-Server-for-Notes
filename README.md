  ## Description
  This is a simple application to take notes throughtout the day. For this project, all of the code for the front-end of the application had been given and the task was to create and connect the backend using express.js.   During this project I learned the basics of using express and how to properly manages files for back-end applications such as creating files for specific routes, utility files and folders for databases.
